**Design Patterns**

It is the most essential part of software engineering, as they provide the general repeatable solution to a commonly occuring problem in Software Design

**Classification:**
1. Creational Design Pattern
2. Structural Design Pattern
3. Behavioral Design Pattern

**Good Pratices for Design Pattern:**
1) **Consistency**: decrease in error, increase in detecting errors, cost savings
2) **Completeness**: how much of what is required
3) **Correctness**: correct results
4) **Coupling**: degree to which your software elements are connected
5) **Cohesion**: degree of independence. More Cohesion and less coupling
6) **Simplicity & Generality trade offs**:
    - wider adoption
    - more functionality
    - too complex
    - simplicity
    - learning curve
    - practitioners
